# Marketing Agency Refactoring

## Description

This project represents a comprehensive refactoring of a marketing agency website to align with accessibility standards. The original site was not compliant with these standards and required extensive modifications to achieve the desired level of accessibility. The following improvements have been made:

- Alt Text: Alt text has been added to all images to enhance both SEO and accessibility.
- Semantic HTML: Semantic HTML elements have been incorporated to improve the overall structure and accessibility of the website.
- Code Sectioning: The source code has been meticulously organized into logical sections, enhancing code readability and workflow.
- Removal of Conflicting IDs and Classes: Inconsistencies in HTML and CSS IDs and classes have been resolved to ensure a harmonious design.
- Code Comments: Comprehensive comments have been added throughout the code to explain the purpose and rationale behind the implemented changes.
- Fixed Broken Links: Broken links on the site have been repaired to ensure a seamless user experience.
