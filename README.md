# Marketing Agency Refactoring

## Description

The aim of this project is to showcase a marketing agency website refactore. The site did not meet accessibility standards and needed refactoring in order to meet these. This has been achieved by: 

- Adding alt text on all images for improved SEO and accessibility 
- Adding semantic HTML elements 
- Sectioning the source code to improve readability and workflow
- Removing conflicting IDs and classes in the HTML and CSS
- Commenting throughout the code explaining the additional changes 
- Fixing broken site links 

## Instilation 

The site and source code and available on GitHub to be cloned and used freely. There is no installation required. 

## Credits 

I would like to thank Horiseon for allowing me to use their site as and refactor it. 

## Licence

This project has no license and is free to use.

## Issues

One issue I had with refactoring was moving the `digital-marketing-meeting` image from the CSS into the HTML without breaking the image. 

Code before: 
- HTML
![This is a snippet of the HTML before I tried to edit the image](assets\images\HTML-before.png)
- CSS
![This is a snippet of the CSS before I tried to edit the image](assets\images\CSS-before.png)


Code after:
- HTML 
![This is a snippet of the HTML after I tried to edit the image](assets\images\HTML-after.png)
- CSS
![This is a snippet of the CSS after I tried to edit the image](assets\images\CSS-after.png)

Result: 

![This is the website with the changes made](assets\images\Broken-site.png)

As you can see the image is too large and fills the entire screen. I would like to add a div to the main section in order to contain the image but I feel I need more confidence with it and want to site to work.
