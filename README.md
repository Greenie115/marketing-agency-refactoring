# Marketing Agency Refactoring

## Description

This project represents a comprehensive refactoring of a marketing agency website to align with accessibility standards. The original site was not compliant with these standards and required extensive modifications to achieve the desired level of accessibility. The following improvements have been made:

- Alt Text: Alt text has been added to all images to enhance both SEO and accessibility.
